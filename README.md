# ActualAntiXRay

This is an actual AntiXRay plugin for PocketMine-MP.

Unlike other so-called "AntiXRay" plugins, this one does not simply inform staff members if an ore is broken.
This plugin actually modifies the chunk packet that is sent to the client to make it look like a chunk contains a ridicioulous amount of ores.
